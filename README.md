# Build a Cat Photo App

A minimal, accessible web page that displays a cat photo — a small front-end project scaffolded for learning HTML, CSS and basic DOM usage.

**What this is**

- A static single-page project containing `index.html` and supporting assets.
- Intended as a beginner-friendly exercise (FreeCodeCamp-style) to practice building and styling simple web pages.

**Features**

- Simple, responsive layout for a cat photo app
- Clear instructions for running locally
- Small, focused codebase (no build tools required)

**Preview**

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the app.

**Run locally**

Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser, or run a minimal local server (recommended for proper relative path handling):

```bash
# from the project root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

**Development**

- Edit `index.html` to change layout or content.
- Add CSS in a new `styles.css` file and link it from `index.html` if you want to style the page.
- Keep it simple — this project is for learning and experimentation.

**Contributing**

- PRs and suggestions welcome. Keep changes small and focused.
